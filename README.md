# YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection ðŸŽ¥ðŸš€ This project demonstrates real-time object detection using Ultralytics YOLOv8 with a live webcam feed. It leverages OpenCV for video streaming and YOLOv8 for state-of-the-art object detection. The project supports real-time detection using your webcam, YOLOv8 pre-trained models (n, s, m, etc.), and is lightweight and easy to extend for custom datasets. To use, clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Oyefusi-Samuel/YOLO-V8-OBJECT-DETECTION-.git` and `cd YOLO-V8-OBJECT-DETECTION-`, then create and activate a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv` and `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `source venv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the program with `python code.py`. Press `q` to exit the live window. The code imports OpenCV and the YOLOv8 model, loads the model with `YOLO("yolov8n.pt")`, opens the default webcam with `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`, performs inference in real time, annotates the frames, and displays them until the user presses `q`. Requirements include ultralytics, opencv-python, numpy, and torch. Example screenshot usage can be shown with an image named `screenshot.png`. Future improvements include training YOLOv8 on a custom dataset for specific object detection tasks, deploying the model to edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, adding real-time alerts or notifications when detecting certain objects, integrating with cloud services for remote monitoring and analytics, and improving the GUI interface for non-technical users.
